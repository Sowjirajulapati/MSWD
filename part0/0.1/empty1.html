<h1>DOGS AND CATS</h1>
<p> Dogs and cats are have made an epic migration from the back yard to the bedroom and from the kennel to the couch. They have ascended the human social ladder starting as hunters and protectors of flock and family, they are now more than valuable objects worth only their cost in dollars. These pets have the same social value as family members. No longer are pets named “spot” or “fido” they now have human names, appear in family photos and represent trust and loyalty more than any other element of society. It is in this new domain of “petdom” that Safari excels. We believe in human level veterinary care for your loved one. We believe in diagnosing and discovering disease before it is clinically apparent. We understand the bond you have with your pet; we know that your pet is a part of your family.Dogs and cats are the most popular pets in the whole world. Even though they’re both very popular, they are different in many ways. Some people gravitate towards the calmness of a cat, while others seek the companionship of a dog. Cats are a lot more independent and less expensive. Cats don’t require nor do they want to be trained to be a house pet. Dogs on the other hand are very loyal and will act as your best friend. Dogs require more attention and training to be a well behaved family member. The main differences between dogs and cats are their personalities, habits, and training, which all determine what pet to choose.
<br><br>
When you’re choosing which pet to get, think about your situation at home and how much free time you have during the day. In today’s household, 36% of them have dogs and 30% of them have cats (U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics). This statistic shows that cats and dogs are the most popular pets and it can be tough to decide which one to get. People that aren’t home a lot shouldn’t get a dog because a dog needs to be played with everyday to keep it health and happy. A cat would be the better choice for someone that is busy a lot because cats wonder and do their own thing, but they will always come back to their home. If you have small kids at home, four or younger, consider getting a cat. Cats are a lot calmer and would be safer around young kids. A dog has a lot of energy and even though they are just trying to play, they could hurt a young kid many different ways. Another thing you need to think about is the size of the animal that you want. All cats are about the same size and there all lap animals. Dogs come in all different sizes; some are small like cats but others are very big. Even though there are small do... difference between a dog and a cat is the training involved. If you want to get a dog you better be prepared to train the dog a lot and you need to have patience with the dog. Dogs learn things slower than cats but dogs also go through more training then cats do. After doing research on both of these animals, I believe that a dog is a better pet because it becomes a part of the family a lot of then a cat does.</p>
